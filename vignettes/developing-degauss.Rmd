The following guide is a step-by-step instruction manual for developing a [DeGAUSS](https://degauss.org) container using tools available in the [`dht` R package](https://degauss.org/dht).

### Creating all files needed

Within an empty directory, use `dht::use_degauss_container()` to create all of the files needed for a DeGAUSS container. Note that the name of this initially empty directory will be used as the name of the geomarker in the documentation, code, and image repository; it is a good idea to only use lower case letters and underscores (e.g., `census_block_group`) to comply with container naming conventions.

- Most of the added files will *usually* not need to be edited:
  - `Makefile` (see below for `Make` targets)
  - `test/my_address_file_geocoded.csv` (test input data file)
  - `LICENSE.md` (GPL license)
  - `.github/workflows/build-deply.yaml` (GitHub Actions continuous integration)
  - `.dockerignore` (edit to include files other than entrypoint.R in the image)

- Files that **need** to be edited:
  - `Dockerfile` (`degauss_description` environment variable)
  - `entrypoint.R` (contains R code to be run in the container)
  - `README.md` (software documentation and example instructions)
  
### Editing files to add R code and documentation

#### Documentation

Add any geomarker information and additional details to `README.md`. Make sure that the version in the example call matches the version of the latest released container. 

Environment variables (`degauss_name`, `degauss_version`, and `degauss_description`) are defined within the `Dockerfile` so that they will be available to R code running from inside the container. All but `degauss_description` are automatically defined and this value needs to be edited from 

```sh
ENV degauss_description="insert short description here that finishes the sentence `This container ...`"
```

to something specific, like

```sh
ENV degauss_description="assigns census block group for different vintages of census geographies"
```

In the future, the environment variable `degauss_version` can be edited in the `Dockerfile` and R code in the container can use it for greetings, writing output files, and other operations that depend on the current version (or name or description).


#### Using R code and data files inside the container

Edit `entrypoint.R` by replacing the example R code with R code that
completes the specific task to be performed by the container.

When ready to build the container, run
`renv::init()` to initiate the `renv` framework and create `renv.lock`. Subsequent builds can update `renv.lock` by using `renv::snapshot()`.

### Including files inside the container

By default, the container will copy in `entrypoint.R` and `renv.lock` for use at runtime and ignore anything else in the working directory to automatically speed up build times and keep containers smaller in size. If the container requires any other files (e.g., `.rds` datafiles), edit
`Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` so that the files are copied to the
container and not ignored by Docker. For example, if we want to use
`geomarker_data.rds`, we would make the following changes in `Dockerfile`:

```sh
    COPY entrypoint.R .
	COPY geomarker_data.rds    # copy .rds file from host to container when building
```

and in `.dockerignore`:

```sh
    # ignore everything
    **

    # except what we need
    !/renv.lock
    !/entrypoint.R
    !/geomarker_data.rds      # make sure the .rds file is not ignored
```

### Tests

A `test` directory is added with an example geocoded address file (`test/my_address_file_geocoded.csv`) and is useful for interactive development and automated testing (see below).

### Using `make` for interactive development

The `Makefile` defines several useful `make` targets that can be useful when locally developing and testing:

- `make build` will build the current DeGAUSS image and name it
- `make test` will run the container on the included example geocoded CSV file
- `make shell` will run a DeGAUSS command, but start an interactive shell inside the container for debugging
- `make clean` is equivalent to `docker system prune -f`, which cleans up any stopped containers or dangling image layers
